Each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.

The triangle starts with a single 1 at the top.

Example for 5 rows


 Features
Generates Pascal’s Triangle for any number of rows.

Uses ArrayList, which allows dynamic sizing:

Unlike arrays, the size of an ArrayList can change during program execution.

This gives flexibility to add more rows as needed.
