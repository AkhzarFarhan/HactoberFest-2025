## Immediate Actions Required

### üî¥ CRITICAL - File Organization Issues
**PRs #377 and #376** have files placed in the root directory instead of proper subdirectories.

**Options:**
1. Request authors to move files to correct locations
2. Move files manually after merge
3. Use the corrected versions provided in this review branch

**Files to relocate:**
- `FixedPointArray.cpp` ‚Üí `C++/Array/FixedPointArray.cpp`
- `partitionPoint.cpp` ‚Üí `C++/Array/partitionPoint.cpp`

### üü° CONFLICT - Duplicate Files
**PRs #371 and #373** both create `C++/Basic Maths/Perfect_no.cpp`

**Resolution:**
- PR #371 has BETTER input validation (recommended version)
- PR #373 also includes `lcm.cpp` which is good quality
- **Recommendation:** Merge PR #371's Perfect_no.cpp and PR #373's lcm.cpp

**PR #374** is a duplicate of existing `C/Insertion Sort.c`
- **Recommendation:** Decline or check if new version is superior
