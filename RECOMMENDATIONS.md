## Specific Recommendations by PR

### PR #379 - Diagonal Swap (Iswarya952)
**Current Status:** Good code, needs minor improvements

**Issues to Address:**
1. Uses Variable Length Array (VLA) which is not standard C++
2. Missing input validation

**Recommended Changes:**
- Replace `int matrix[n][n]` with `vector<vector<int>> matrix(n, vector<int>(n))`
- Add input validation after reading `n`

**Action:** Created `C++/Array/diagonal_swap_improved.cpp` with these fixes.

**Merge Recommendation:** ✅ APPROVE with suggested improvements

---

### PR #378 - Permutations (Vivekpusti)
**Current Status:** Good algorithm, needs header fix

**Issues to Address:**
1. Uses non-standard `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`
2. No user input
3. Missing newline at end

**Recommended Changes:**
```cpp
// Replace this:
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

// With this:
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
```

**Action:** Created `C++/Recursion/permutationsOfString_improved.cpp` with these fixes.

**Merge Recommendation:** ✅ APPROVE with suggested improvements

### PR #377 - Fixed Point Array (bhumikahaldiya)
**Current Status:** Code quality good, CRITICAL file location issue

**Issues to Address:**
1. ❌ **CRITICAL:** File in root directory instead of `C++/Array/`
2. Uses non-standard `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`
3. No user input option

**Required Changes:**
1. **MUST:** Move file from `/FixedPointArray.cpp` to `/C++/Array/FixedPointArray.cpp`
2. Replace headers with standard ones
3. Add better documentation

**Action:** Created properly organized file at `C++/Array/FixedPointArray.cpp`

**Merge Recommendation:** ⚠️ REQUEST CHANGES - File must be in proper directory

---

### PR #376 - Partition Point (bhumikahaldiya)
**Current Status:** Code quality good, CRITICAL file location issue

**Issues to Address:**
1. ❌ **CRITICAL:** File in root directory instead of `C++/Array/`
2. Uses non-standard `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`
3. Typo: "Iteratte" should be "Iterate"
4. No user input option

**Required Changes:**
1. **MUST:** Move file from `/partitionPoint.cpp` to `/C++/Array/partitionPoint.cpp`
2. Replace headers with standard ones
3. Fix typo
4. Add better documentation

**Action:** Created properly organized file at `C++/Array/partitionPoint.cpp`

**Merge Recommendation:** ⚠️ REQUEST CHANGES - File must be in proper directory

---

### PR #375 - Knight's Tour (BhushanVidhate-27)
**Current Status:** EXCELLENT quality code

**Issues to Address:**
1. Minor: Missing newline at end of file

**Recommended Changes:**
- Add newline at end
- (Optional) Consider making board size configurable

**Action:** Created `C++/Backtracking/knights_tour_fixed.cpp` with newline added.

**Merge Recommendation:** ✅ APPROVE - This is one of the best PRs!

---

### PR #374 - Insertion Sort (debojyoti10CC)
**Current Status:** DUPLICATE of existing file

**Issues to Address:**
1. ❌ **DUPLICATE:** File `C/Insertion Sort.c` already exists
2. The new version doesn't add significant improvements

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Check if existing file has the same quality
2. If the new version is better, replace the old one
3. Otherwise, decline this PR as duplicate

**Merge Recommendation:** ❌ DECLINE or REPLACE - This is a duplicate contribution

---

### PR #373 - LCM and Perfect Number (Hansika1225)
**Current Status:** Good code quality, conflict with PR #371

**Issues to Address:**
1. ⚠️ Perfect_no.cpp conflicts with PR #371 (same file path)
2. Both files are good quality

**Analysis:**
- `lcm.cpp` - Good implementation, no issues
- `Perfect_no.cpp` - Good but lacks the input validation from PR #371

**Merge Recommendation:** 
- ✅ APPROVE `lcm.cpp`
- ⚠️ CONFLICT on `Perfect_no.cpp` - PR #371 has better version

---

### PR #372 - Conway's Game of Life (Code-with-pratik-07)
**Current Status:** EXCELLENT feature-rich implementation

**Issues to Address:**
1. Missing dependency documentation (pygame)
2. Filename has space (should use underscore)
3. Missing newline at end

**Recommended Changes:**
1. Rename to `conways_game_of_life.py`
2. Add docstring with dependencies and controls
3. Add requirements.txt or document pygame dependency

**Action:** Created `Python/conways_game_of_life_improved.py` with these improvements.

**Merge Recommendation:** ✅ APPROVE with suggested improvements - Excellent work!

---

### PR #371 - Perfect Number (Hansika1225)
**Current Status:** Good code with better input validation

**Issues to Address:**
1. ⚠️ Conflicts with PR #373 Perfect_no.cpp

**Analysis:**
- This version has BETTER input validation than PR #373
- Checks for cin.fail() and negative numbers
- More robust error handling

**Merge Recommendation:** ✅ APPROVE - This version is better than #373's Perfect_no.cpp

---

## Priority Actions

### HIGH PRIORITY (Must be addressed before merge):

1. **PR #377 & #376:** Author must move files to proper directories
   - Contact author to request file relocation
   - Or manually move files after merge

2. **PR #374:** Resolve duplicate
   - Compare with existing `C/Insertion Sort.c`
   - Decide whether to keep, reject, or replace

3. **PR #373 vs #371:** Resolve Perfect_no.cpp conflict
   - PR #371 has better input validation
   - Suggest merging #371's version
   - Keep #373's lcm.cpp

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (Improvements):

1. **Multiple PRs:** Replace `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` with standard headers
   - PRs affected: #377, #376, #378

2. **PR #379:** Replace VLA with vector

3. **PR #372:** Add documentation and rename file

### LOW PRIORITY (Nice to have):

1. Add user input options to files with hardcoded test cases
2. Add complexity analysis comments where missing
3. Consider adding optimized versions for some algorithms

## Recommendations for Future PR Guidelines

Based on this review, consider adding these guidelines to your repository:

1. **File Organization:**
   - Always place files in appropriate subdirectories
   - Never commit to root directory unless it's a project-level file

2. **Code Standards:**
   - Use standard C++ headers, not `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`
   - Add input validation for user inputs
   - Include newline at end of all files
   - Avoid Variable Length Arrays in C++

3. **Documentation:**
   - Add comments explaining the algorithm
   - Include time and space complexity
   - Add usage examples or test cases

4. **Before Submitting:**
   - Check for duplicate files
   - Test code with multiple inputs
   - Verify file is in correct directory
   - Run linter if available
